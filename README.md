# Quiz-Game
This is a comprehensive and error-free Quiz Game Mini Project in C that is meant to run on a console. 
In this project, the user is asked a series of questions and is offered a monetary reward for each accurate response.
In a quiz game, the questions are selected to encompass all aspects of a traditional quiz competition. Quizzes on science, technology, movies, sports, general health, geography, and other topics put the user's general knowledge to the test.
I broken this little project into many functions, and we've highlighted a few of them below to help you understand it better.
edit_score() – adds the current cash prize won to the previous one upon giving the right answer to a question
help() – help menu with game summary and rules
reset_score() – to reset the highest score/cash prize to default
show_record() – shows the highest cash prize won by a particular user
show_score() – to view the highest score
The first of the two rounds I described is known as the Warm-up Round, and the second is known as the Challenge Round.
The user is offered three straightforward questions in the warm-up round, and they must successfully answer at least two of them to advance to the following round.
If the user is unable of doing so, he will not be allowed to continue.
The user will be asked questions incessantly in the second and more fascinating round of this quiz game in C, and for each correct answer supplied, they will be awarded $100,000!
When the user's monetary award reaches $1 million, the game is over. There are four alternatives for each question: A, B, C, and D. Because there are no negative indications, the user's accrued cash money will not be removed for incorrect responses.
